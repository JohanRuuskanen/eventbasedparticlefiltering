Restructure the project nicer, e.g. create src with all funcs, create tests with all
demonstrative tests. Extract funcs such as resampling to funcs

Examine effect of lowering M for APF

Examine how the posterior distribution looks like for BPF/APF for a controlled
system with SOD

Concatenate filters and filters eventbased? They are the same if we trigger on
all values

Is it possible to concatenate EBPF/EAPF by defining the sample/resample in
another script?

Is the calculation of Neff correct? For APF it should not be based on V, only
on W. V could be used to calculate a "predictive" V for resampling. W is however
tied to how we weight the particles and thus decides the "correct" sampling decay.
